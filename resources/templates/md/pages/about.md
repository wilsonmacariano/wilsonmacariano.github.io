Hey! My name is Wilson Filho, I'm a Brazilian Programmer based in Fortaleza, Cear√°.</p><p>In this blog I will be documenting my experiences, some tutorials and maybe I will even opinate hoping I can contribute with the programming community. My main language today is Java, but I also do work with JavaScript, some HTML and CSS. I also like experimenting with different languages like Clojure and Scala.
